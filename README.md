Markov Chain Text Generator (Task 03)

This is my Task-03 project for Prodigy InfoTech – Generative AI Internship.
In this project, I created a simple Markov Chain based text generator using Python.
It generates new text by learning the pattern of words from a given input text.

-- What this project does
Takes a sample paragraph/text
Splits the text into words
Creates a Markov model (word → next possible word)
Generates new text word-by-word using probability

-- Technologies Used
Python
Basic concepts: dictionaries, loops, random module

--Files in this Repository
task03_markov.py → Python program for text generation
README.md → Project details

-- How to Run
Download or clone the repository
Open terminal in the project folder

Run this command:
python3 task03_markov.py

-- Output
The program prints a new generated text based on the input paragraph.

--What I learned
How Markov Chain works in text generation
How to store word connections using dictionaries
How random selection helps generate text
